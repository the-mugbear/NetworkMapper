# Technical Debt, Redundancy, and Optimization

Here is a consolidated list of issues and recommendations for improvement:

*   **[High] Lack of Automated Tests:** The absence of tests is the most significant issue. Adding a testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for the backend, `jest` and `react-testing-library` for the frontend) and writing unit and integration tests should be a high priority.
*   **[Medium] Inefficient Database Operations:** In some of the parsers (`eyewitness_parser.py`, `masscan_parser.py`), the code commits to the database multiple times within a loop. This should be refactored to use a single commit at the end of the parsing process to improve performance and ensure atomicity.
*   **[Medium] Generic Exception Handling:** The code often uses broad `except Exception` blocks. This should be replaced with more specific exception handling to improve error reporting and debugging.
*   **[Low] Hardcoded Configuration:** Some configuration values (e.g., API version) are hardcoded. These should be moved to the configuration file.
*   **[Low] Frontend State Management:** For the current size of the application, the state management is adequate. However, as the application grows, consider using a dedicated state management library like Redux or Zustand.
*   **[Low] Dockerfile Optimization:** The Dockerfiles can be optimized by using multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size. For example, the backend Dockerfile includes build-time dependencies like `gcc` in the final image.
*   **[Low] Redundant Code in Frontend API:** The `exportScopeReport`, `exportScanReport`, and `exportOutOfScopeReport` functions in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` have very similar code for creating and triggering a download. This could be refactored into a single helper function.
*   **[Low] Database Initialization:** The `models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` call in `main.py` is convenient for development but not ideal for production. Since Alembic is already a dependency, it should be used to manage database migrations.
